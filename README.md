# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the Pewlett Hackard "silver tsunami" analysis
Leveraging Pewlett Hackard’s (PH) employee data, provided to us in CSV files, we’ve been asked to build a database to perform analysis on the company’s aging employee population. This ask came in a response to the coming wave of retirements, at the company, known as the “Silver Tsunami”. 

## Results
In analyzing the employee data per the ask of Pewlett Hackard, we’ve determined that there is extreme risk of brain drain due the number of retiring employees. First, the immediate concern is driven by the number of “Senior Engineers” found to be 25,916. Second, on the other end of the spectrum are the retiring Managers found to be only 2. See image below highlighting the number of employees retiring by title.

-- Large concern tied to the number of retiring employees.

-- Of those retiring the biggest risk is tied to the number of Senior Engineers (25,916).

To counter the risk of employees retiring without a backfill, there are mentorship opportunities available to leverage. Again reviewing the employee data, we’ve found there are 1549 employees that can be tapped to assist with upskilling the next generation of employees. Of the 1549, PH has 381 “Senior Engineers” who could potentially assist with this task. An initial concern is the lack of mentorship availability tied to the “Manager” role. See image below highlighting these numbers.

-- 1549 employees are poised to assist with mentoring and upskilling the remaining employee population
-- The lack of mentors available to support the mentoring and upskilling of potential Managers is concerning. 

## Summary
In summary, we’ve determined there is an extreme risk to Pewlett Hackard and its productivity due to coming retirements within the employee population. In total 72k+ employees will need to be replaced to continue operations as is. With only 1500 mentors available to train and upskill the remaining population, Pewlett Hackard has its work ahead of it. We suggest that both hiring and mentoring programs should be implemented as soon as possible. Following up on the mentoring program, we suggest focusing on those who have spent the least amount of time with the company and work backwards. In the image below we can see the breakdown of 1500 mentors by their joining year.

To narrow the focus better, we’d suggest running the pilot with those who have joined since 2000. See the breakdown of these mentors by title below.
